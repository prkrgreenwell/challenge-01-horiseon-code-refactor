# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
I was given starter code for the Horiseon website homepage for this project. My goal was to make things more accessible. I added alt descriptions for images and comments on the css documentation. I also searched the HTML for best practices and fixed a link.

## Installation

## Usage
This page is the homepage for the Horiseon Search Engine Optimization company. 

## Credits 
I took the starter code from the urban-octo-telegram repo in Xandromus' GitHub account.
